# 🤖 Nostalgia Sundae Agent

Welcome to **Nostalgia Sundae Agent** — the world’s first chat agent with a memory as sweet and selective as your favorite childhood treat! This isn’t just a chatbot; it’s a mood-savvy, personality-packed companion that remembers what matters, forgets what doesn’t, and always knows when to sprinkle a little comfort on your day.

---

## 🌈 What Makes It Special?

- **Long-Term, Contextual Memory:**
  - Remembers up to 5,000 messages, but only brings up your preferences when it *matters* (e.g., when you’re feeling down).
- **Selective Recall:**
  - Shares your quirks and comforts only in relevant, supportive moments. Never awkwardly blurts out your secrets during happy times!
- **Proactive Personality:**
  - Responds in a single, creative, and caring sentence—never generic, always with a Sundae twist.
- **No Memory Leaks:**
  - Your preferences stay private unless the mood calls for a gentle reminder.
- **Easy to Test & Demo:**
  - Comes with a playful test script to show off its memory magic.

## 🍦 How Does It Work?

1. **You Share:**
   - Tell the agent something personal ("I like eating ice cream when I’m anxious.")
2. **You Distract:**
   - Chat about anything else—vacations, movies, the weather. The agent keeps your secret safe.
3. **You Reveal a Mood:**
   - Express a negative feeling ("I’m anxious.")
4. **The Sundae Moment:**
   - The agent recalls your comfort and offers a sweet, supportive, personality-driven response.

   python main.py
   ```
2. **Test the Magic:**

3. **Watch as the agent remembers *just* when you need it most!**

Bot: That’s awesome! Productivity is its own reward.

Bot: Maybe a scoop of your favorite ice cream would help right now.
```
